<h2>Escape - A Simple Turing Game</h2>
<p>On March 30th, at 9pm at night, I began drawing up basic designs for a game that I wanted to build just to advance my skills with Turing for Grade 11 Computer Science. Little did I know that project would ignite my passion in programming, and start me on a life long journey to learn and grow.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, I spent countless hours drawing out designs, planning functions, and testing with other classmates. When it was finally complete, I experienced for once the feeling of success. I had accomplished something great with my own knowledge and code, and the faces of my classmates and teacher changed my life.</p> 
<p>Behold my first ever project, and although not my best, the beginning of them all. <br><i>Will you be able to escape?</i><p>
